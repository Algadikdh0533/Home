# Machine readable JSON output for dotnet listÂ package

* Status: **In Review**
* Author: [Erick Yondon](https://github.com/erdembayar)
* GitHub Issue [7752](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7752)

## Problem background
<!-- Why are we doing this? What pain points does this solve? What is the expected outcome? -->
Many organizations are required by [regulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) to audit packages that they're using in a repository.

Currently there's no easy way to produce a [Software Bill of Material (SBOM)](https://blog.sonatype.com/what-is-a-software-bill-of-materials) output which can be consumed by another auditing system or kept for records.

* Parse-friendly output. Other package managers like [NPM already have it](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ls) (`npm ls --parseable` and `npm ls --json`).
* Useful for CI/CD auditing(compliance, security ..)
  * Produce Software Bill of Material (SBOM) (compliance, historic keeping)
  * Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security
    * Check any vulnerable packages
    * Check any deprecated packages
    * Check any outdated packages
  * Check license compliance
  * Resolve dependency issues (detect duplicate packages, newly introduced dependencies, dependency removals, etc.)
  * Making the output machine-readable unlocks additional tooling and automation scenarios in CI/CD pipeline above scenarios.

## Who are the customers

Anyone (government/private enterprises, security experts, individual contributors) who wants to consume `dotnet list package` output for auditing tool or historic keeping, CI/CD orchestrating.

## Explanation

### Functional explanation

<!-- Explain the proposal as if it were already implemented and you're teaching it to another person. -->
<!-- Introduce new concepts, functional designs with real life examples, and low-fidelity mockups or  pseudocode to show how this proposal would look. -->

#### `--format` option

Ability to use new `--format` option for all `dotnet list package` commands to ensure formatted(json, text, csv etc) output is emitted to the console.

```dotnetcli
dotnet list [<PROJECT>|<SOLUTION>] package [--config <SOURCE>]
    [--deprecated]
    [--framework <FRAMEWORK>] [--highest-minor] [--highest-patch]
    [--include-prerelease] [--include-transitive] [--interactive]
    [--outdated] [--source <SOURCE>] [-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>]
    [--vulnerable]
    [--format <FORMAT>]

dotnet list package -h|--help

## Compatibility

 We start with `version 1`, as long as we don't remove or rename then it'll be backward compatible. In case [we change version](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13945074) just add new properties, keep old ones even it's not used.

## Out-of-scope

* We won't support saving the machine-readable output to disk as part of this spec. The work-around is for the consumer to read from the console's stdout stream.
* At this point, no other CLI commands (e.g. dotnet list reference) will be within scope for this feature.
"--parsable" option needs separate spec.
* Currently license info is not emitted from any cli command, it could be quite useful, we should consider in the future.

## Rationale and alternatives
Currently, no other `dotnet command` implemented this, this is the 1st time dotnet command implementing `json`(etc) output, so it could become example for others next time they implement.
Please note, except "tab completion" (for dotnet) part all changes would be inside NuGet.Client repo(under NuGet.Core), and risk of introducing regression is low.(`--format text` refactoring related changes only come into my mind.), no impact on dotnet sdk.

## Prior Art

<!-- What prior art, both good and bad are related to this proposal? -->
<!-- Do other features exist in other ecosystems and what experience have their community had? -->
<!-- What lessons from other communities can we learn from? -->
<!-- Are there any resources that are relevent to this proposal? -->

* https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dotnet-audit/proposed/2021/DotNetAudit.md#dotnet-audit---futjson There're some overlaps, but current spec is one more focused on SBOM and CI/CD actions, while `dotnet audit fix` is more focused detecting/fixing dependencies manually. Current spec already include ideas from this spec like `json format`.

* https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-Machine-readable-output-for-dotnet-list-package Basic idea from this spec is still same here and I extended from it. In current spec more orient to `dotnet style syntax` and cover more uses cases like `dotnet list package --vulnerable --format json` and `--include-transitive`, also json schema improved to include project name/identifier for multi-project scenario which would most likely use case.

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters One idea we can take from `dotnet counter` is we can specify output file with `-o`, `--output` option. So instead of writing output into console, it allows output directly saved into file. It allows both `csv` and `json` formats, currently saved file doesn't have version concept.

* https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Enable-repeatable-package-restore-using-lock-file It's very similar what we're doing here, and it has schema versioning. [sample](https://gist.github.com/erdembayar/4894b66bde227147b60e60997d20df41) Only major difference is json object are grouped under TFM unlike `dotnet list package` where items are grouped under projects. Below are possible takeaways.
  * Direct/top level packages point to dependency packages. >> Could be included, down side is duplicate information, increase json size. Also I feel https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11553 addresses this issue better, because in the end who transitive dependency brought in is more important than what dependencies exist under each top package.
  * Content hash. >> It's very easy to include it, question is how about source? Related issue https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11552

* [npm ls --json](https://gist.github.com/erdembayar/ddfbf9c160fbb8a0e31e3596f03ee906), [npm outdated -json](https://gist.github.com/erdembayar/12030f1db89ad9f2e206f2b6ff7d740f) Actually it's less sophisticated than what we have, because it doesn't have multi TFM and projects concept.

## Future Possibilities

If we address them in plain `dotnet list package` then we'll address in `json output` too.

* Include source info for all  options. https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11556

* Include hash + source for package, because same package ID+version might have different hash. It can be used to detect [dependency confusion attack](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11446#discussion_r767030495), tracking issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11552

* Include hash for each package, sub issue of above. This's low hanging fruit I can include it.

* Include [path info](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11446#discussion_r798509892) for project (either relative to current working dir or relative to solution): tracking issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11562

* Some outputs include source info. Maybe we should include package source mapping info into sources, tracking issue https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11557

* Show resolution tree for transitive dependencies and constraint for dependency [resolved version](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11446/files#r777233006), tracking issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11553

* Include-transitive dependencies by default [r766924390](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11446#discussion_r766924390), workaround pass `--include-transitive`, tracking issue https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11550

* `--all` option for dotnet list package [r766860629](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/11446#discussion_r766860629), tracking issue https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/11551

* Return different exit codes if any vulnerabilities, deprecations, outdated package is [detected](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dotnet-audit/proposed/2021/DotNetAudit.md#dotnet-audit-exit-codes).
