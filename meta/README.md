# NuGet Proposal Process

## How do I create a proposal?

## How does a proposal review work?

The official place for discussion for a proposal is it's pull request or a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/discussions). Anyone, both NuGet contributors and non-contributors can participate in the discussion and ask questions and provide constructive feedback to the proposal. Please keep in mind that only NuGet contributors are able to act upon the proposal even if other users can comment.

All discussions surrounding a proposal are covered by the [.NET Foundation code of conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). Please keep discussions constructive, respectful, and focused on what's best for the .NET ecosystem. If discussions get heated, the NuGet team may at it's own discretion moderate the discussion to enforce the code of conduct.
